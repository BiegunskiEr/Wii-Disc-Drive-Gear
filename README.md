# Wii-Disc-Drive-Gear

This file contains a 3D model of a helical gear found inside of a Nintendo Wii DVD drive. The file type is CTB and has been sliced with ChituBox.  

This is a helical gear that is compatible with the Nintendo Wii's DVD disc drive. 
Please note that this gear may not work with your drive and further modification to your drive may be necessary. 
The modification I recomend is as follows:

The shaft that this gear is attatched to is not secured tightly 
If this shaft lifts, the gear will lose contact and bind 
This will cause loss of function to your DVD drive 
You must secure this shaft in a way such that it can not move up and down freely
I suggest you drill a hole in the metal plate directly above this shaft
In this hole, put a small screw and tighten it so it is just above the shaft
When you put the metal play back on the disc drive, the screw will act as a hard stop for the shaft
Not allowing it to move up and down freely
